Hello, I'm Sterling. I'm studying Web & Computer Programming, and I live in Bluffdale, UT. I'm currently building an app that connects nannies and clients to help local teenagers gain work experience while giving parents more time to recuperate and refresh. I love creating digital products and systems that make life easier, help people connect, and spark inspiration. My goal is to build a career that supports my family and helps us grow closer to the Lord.
